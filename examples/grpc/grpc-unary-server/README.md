# GRPC Server Example

This Kite example showcases a basic gRPC unary server implementation. For detailed instructions on setting up gRPC handlers with Kite’s context support—enabling built-in tracing and database integration within your gRPC handlers—please refer to our [official documentation](https://github.com/sllt/kite/docs/advanced-guide/grpc).

### To run the example use the command below:
```console
go run main.go
```
